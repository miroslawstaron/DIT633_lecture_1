# DIT 633 - Development of Embedded and Realtime systems

This repository contains the source code for the first lecture, starting 2025

## Changes to the previous years
1. We use WSL2 and not Visual Studio 2020 any more
2. We use header files and Makefiles

## Rules for making changes
I appreciate if you add cool programs and ideas for the lecture. Here is how to do it:

1. Add a new file with the new function
2. Declare the function in myHeader.h
3. Add a piece of code that calls this function from the main() in main.c
4. Create a pull request with a short description of the rationale
